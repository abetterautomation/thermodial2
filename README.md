### An updated version of thermodial ###

The first version of thermodial was created to show a basic example of how
to add a nice graphical display to a text-based program, but its intended
simplicity came with limited functional capability. This second version has
important updates that allow the user much greater adaptability at run-time,
such as changing units and selecting different temperature sensors.

The code is more advanced than version 1, although the use of class
declarations was purposesly avoided to keep the code limited to functions
like the original. For version 1, click [here](../../../thermodial).
